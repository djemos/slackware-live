Slackware-Live requires the following utilities (and their dependencies) to operate:
- UnionFS-FUSE or AUFS (if kernel support it),
- SquashFS-Tools - support XZ/LZMA compression if kernel and tools support it (XZ is enabled in 2.6.38 Slackware testing kernel),
- SysLinux & eLiLo,
- MkInitRD.

The installation procedure is:
1) extract the archive containing the program sources,
2) run the command `make install'
	(or `make install DESTDIR=/absolute/path/to/destination' to place the files
	in a temporary location instead of the expected one).
