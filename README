Slackware Live is a live DVD/USB/NFS build and install tool written for Slackware (& Slackware64) Linux:
- support GPT and legacy MBR partitionned disks, UEFI and CSM (legacy / BIOS) booting
- contains all the necessary to convert an installed system to a live system and vice-versa;
- it doesn't need any kernel recompile, but it support seamlessly AUFS and SquashFS-XZ/LZMA if your kernel support them;
- no changes are needed on the system to make live; the live system boots like an installed one (100% compatible with stock Slackware);
- support persistent changes;
- ...

A GUI for the installation program and a synchronization tool (for home directory backup/restore) are provided separately;


This creates an initrd and a Slackel ive iso and also is used to install the live iso creating a new user and a password and set a password for root.
Can also install the live iso as a frugal installation to a usb to use persistence.
